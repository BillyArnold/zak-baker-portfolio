                    <p>Iâ€™ve been fortunate to have worked my entire career in studios with large format mixing consoles, analogue outboard and high-end plugins. Currently I am mixing out of Blue Bell Hill Studios in Kent with an acoustically designed control room and SSL G series desk. Please get in contact with the email at the bottom of this page, so we can discuss your project.

                    <p>Whether it&apos;s full band recordings or vocal sessions. The recording is the foundation for your song&apos;s sound, a great recording is vital for a powerful mix. As someone that works frequently with the Dolby Atmos format, I am also equipped with spatial audio recording techniques for recordings to get the most out of the immersive mixing formats.

I am both available as the in-house engineer at Blue Bell Hill Studios in Kent for recording, as well as freelance engineering jobs. Please get in contact with the email at the bottom of this page to discuss your project and availability.

                    <p>Track time alignment for both instrumental tracks and vocal tracks. Discreet pitch correction with Melodyne. If you feel they are required, can be very crucial steps to getting your song to make the leap to sounding professional. If your track needs extensive editing before the mix stage, please get in touch with the email below. If you&apos;re unsure if you need extensive editing, mention it anyway and we can figure out if it&apos;s needed.
